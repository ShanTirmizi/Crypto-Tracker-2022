# Crypto-Tracker-2022

Fullstack crypto tracker built using React on the front end and express & node in the back end. The website uses coin geckos API to fetch the data and display it in a list form. Users can click on the coin to get further details about the coin such as a chart showing the historical data. Users also have the ability to search through the coins and add them to a watch list.

The back end is deployed on heroku and the front end is deployed on Netlify.
